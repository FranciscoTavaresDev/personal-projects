# Project Introduction:

This is just a veryyyyy basic project I setup in my spare time. Tried to keep it as barebones as possible and avoided frameworks with the intention of learning whats under the hood. Currently playing around with Elasticsearch with the intention of implementing it. The backend itself is extremely simple as it was meant as a POC, will be periodically updated with the objective of creating an MVP with user action traceability. 

### Enjoy! (Better documentation coming soon.)
